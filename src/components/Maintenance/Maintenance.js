                    <section>
                        <p>Routine preventative maintenance for your roof is a kin to changing the oil in your vehicle. If you spend a little money to put good oil in it at scheduled intervals, it will last a very long time and provide years of trouble-free service. This minor expense will come back to you many times over in how long your vehicle lasts and its value at trade-in, not to mention the major premature expense avoided if the oil changes aren’t performed.</p>
                        <p>For most roofs, we recommend inspection and routine repair twice per year; usually in the spring and fall. These inspections include:</p>
                        <p>A walk-thru inspection of the field of the roof, perimeter flashings and details, termination points, roof-top equipment and their flashings, drains, gutters and scuppers. Removal of accumulated debris on the roof and around drainage points; i.e. drains, gutters, scuppers, etc. Repair of routine discovered defects using quality products compatible with your roof system, including follow up details of the repairs performed with photos.</p>
                        <p>Notification of any serious problems with a proposal for repair. Notification of any discovered defects with roof-top equipment and/or items not directly related to the roof system.</p>

                        <h2>What should you pay for a preventative maintenance service?</h2>

                        <p>We perform hundreds of preventative maintenance inspections and certainly believe we’re entitled to make a fair profit on this work. Unfortunately, many contractors offer this service with the intention of let’s say “hitting it out of the park” from a profit standpoint.</p>
                        <p>Here’s how. Many contractors offer this service for a fixed cost based on a square footage price, which appears to be very inexpensive; routinely 5 to 10 cents per square foot with a minimum charge. If your building is 50,000sqft, at a nickel a square foot, you’re looking at $2500. Arguably not an exorbitant amount, however, if the roof’s not too complex, and in decent condition, the legitimate charge to perform the inspection could easily be as low as $1,200; less than half of what you’re going to pay.</p>
                        <p>We believe there are far too many variables with these inspections and repairs to apply a “one size fits all” price structure that covers us in the worst scenario. For this reason, the vast majority of the time, we perform this work on a time &amp; material basis, providing a fair situation for both contractor and owner.</p>
                        <p>Our philosophy is if we take care of you and provide value on the little stuff, odds are you’ll choose Premier for the big stuff.</p>
